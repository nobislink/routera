Although connecting a calendar to Routera is optional, it is strongly recommended. Connecting your calendar will automatically update your availability based on your calendar events. Routera currently supports either a **Google Calendar** account or an **Outlook Calendar** account.

You can use the following resources to create a calendar account if you haven't done so:

- [Google](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/56256?hl=en)
- [Microsoft](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/account-billing/how-to-create-a-new-microsoft-account-a84675c3-3e9e-17cf-2911-3d56b15c0aaf)

<Warning>
  You can only connect one calendar account per user. Additionally, only Microsoft 365 Outlook Calendar accounts are supported.
