Routers are a core feature of Routera, allowing you to assign leads efficiently. To create a router, follow these steps:

- In the left sidebar, click on **Routers**, then **Create Router**
- When prompted, confirm whether you are using HubSpot by selecting **Yes** or **No**.

  You can connect your HubSpot account by following the instructions of [this article](#)

### If you're using your HubSpot account

The **HubSpot Configuration** tab includes the following settings:

- \*\*The router's name as "Unnamed Router": \*\*You can click on this title to change its name.
- **HubSpot Object:** Select the HubSpot object type (e.g., Contacts, Deals) you want to assign.
- **Owner Property:** Choose the owner property (e.g., Contact Owner) used for assignments. You can create additional owner properties in HubSpot by following [this guide](https://knowledge.hubspot.com/properties/create-and-edit-properties).
- **Overwrite Options:** Define how the router should handle assignments when an object record already has an owner:
  - **Never Overwrite:** Keeps the existing owner if one is already assigned.
  - **Overwrite Only if Current User Is Not Available:** Reassigns only if the current owner is unavailable (e.g., outside working hours or out of office).
  - **Always Overwrite:** Reassigns the record to the new owner regardless of the current owner.

When you finish setting these options, click on **Next **<Icon icon="arrow-right" /> to select your router's users. The following options will appear:

- **Do you want to select users manuall or from a team?** **Manually** select users individually for this rotation, or select **Team** to add an entire teamâ€”making it easier to manage members across multiple routers by updating the team.
