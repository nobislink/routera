Routers are the core feature of Routera, allowing you to assign records efficiently. To create a router, follow these steps:

- In the left sidebar, click on **Routers**, then **Create Router**
- When prompted, confirm whether you are using HubSpot by selecting **Yes** or **No**.

<Note>
  You can connect your HubSpot account by following the instructions of [this article](#)
</Note>

### If you're using your HubSpot account

The **HubSpot Configuration** tab includes the following settings:

![Clean Shot2025 08 14at16 35 04 Pn](/images/CleanShot2025-08-14at16.35.04.png)

- **The router's name as "Unnamed Router":** You can click on this title to change its name.
- **HubSpot Object:** Select the HubSpot object type (e.g., Contacts, Deals) you want to assign.
- **Owner Property:** Choose the owner property (e.g., Contact Owner) used for assignments. You can create additional owner properties in HubSpot by following [this guide](https://knowledge.hubspot.com/properties/create-and-edit-properties).
- **Overwrite Options:** Define how the router should handle assignments when an object record already has an owner:
  - **Never Overwrite:** Keeps the existing owner if one is already assigned.
  - **Overwrite Only if Current User Is Not Available:** Reassigns only if the current owner is unavailable (e.g., outside working hours or out of office).
  - **Always Overwrite:** Reassigns the record to the new owner regardless of the current owner.

When you finish setting these options up, click on **Next** <Icon icon="arrow-right" /> to select your router's **Users**. The following options will appear:

- **Do you want to select users manuall or from a team?** **Manually** select users individually for this rotation, or select **Team** to add an entire team—making it easier to manage members across multiple routers by updating the team.
- **Backup user**: Select a backup user so they receive assignments when all other users are unavailable, ensuring the rotation is always covered.
- **Disable backup user**: If the backup user is disabled, no owner will be assigned when all users are unavailable
- **Disable working hours when all users are unavailable:** Selecting this option allows the rotation to assign as if all users were available when everyone is outside their office hours, effectively bypassing office hours <u>only in that case</u>.

When you're done, click **Next** <Icon icon="arrow-right" /> to open the **Model** tab. The following options will appear:

- **Round Robin tab:** The round robin tab allow you to distribute your records equally. Every user will receive the same amount of records. You may drag and drop each user to change its order.

![Clean Shot2025 08 14at17 15 58 Pn](/images/CleanShot2025-08-14at17.15.58.png)

- **Percentage tab:** The percentage tab will allow you to control the percentage of records each user will receive on each rotation. You may change each user's percentage by changing their corresponding number.

![Clean Shot2025 08 14at17 37 08 Pn](/images/CleanShot2025-08-14at17.37.08.png)

<Note>
  The total percentage must equal 100%, otherwise, Routera will return an error
</Note>

- **View queue: **this option will allow you to preview how the first 100 records will be distributed under that model.

After setting up the router’s model, click **Next** to open the Account Matching tab. When enabled, this feature matches the owner (if available) of an associated object to the one selected in your router’s **HubSpot Configuration **tab.

For example, if you selected **Contacts** as the **HubSpot object**, **Account Matching** can match the owner of an associated company, deal, or ticket—provided those objects have an assigned owner.

When you click on **Enable account matching**, the following options will appear:

- **Which HubSpot object do you want to match the owner from? **Select the desired object from the dropdown list.
- **Which _object_ should we select?** Choose whether to match the _most recently updated_, _most recently created_, or _first created_ object.

When finished, click **Save & Publish** to publish your router. 

### Setting up a workflow for your router.

With your router published, you can now create a workflow to use it. Follow these steps:
