Routers are a core feature of Routera, allowing you to assign records efficiently. To create a router, follow these steps:

- In the left sidebar, click **Routers**, then **Create Router**.
- When prompted, confirm whether you are using HubSpot by selecting **Yes** or **No**.

<Note>
  You can connect your HubSpot account by following the instructions in [this article](#).
</Note>

### If You're Using Your HubSpot Account

The **HubSpot Configuration** tab includes the following settings:

![Clean Shot2025 08 14at16 35 04 Pn](/images/CleanShot2025-08-14at16.35.04.png)

- **The router's name as "Unnamed Router":** Click the title to change the name.
- **HubSpot Object:** Select the HubSpot object type (e.g., Contacts, Deals) you want to assign.
- **Owner Property:** Choose the owner property (e.g., Contact Owner) used for assignments. You can create additional owner properties in HubSpot by following [this guide](https://knowledge.hubspot.com/properties/create-and-edit-properties).
- **Overwrite Options:** Define how the router should handle assignments when an object record already has an owner:
  - **Never Overwrite:** Keeps the existing owner if one is already assigned.
  - **Overwrite Only if Current User Is Not Available:** Reassigns only if the current owner is unavailable (e.g., outside working hours or out of office).
  - **Always Overwrite:** Reassigns the record to the new owner regardless of the current owner.

When you finish setting these options, click **Next** <Icon icon="arrow-right" /> to select your router's **Users**. The following options will appear:

![Clean Shot2025 08 14at17 06 11copy Pn](/images/CleanShot2025-08-14at17.06.11copy.png)

- **Do you want to select users manually or from a team?** Select **Manually** to choose individual users for this rotation, or **Team** to add an entire team—making it easier to manage members across multiple routers by updating the team.
- **Backup user:** Select a backup user to receive assignments when all other users are unavailable, ensuring the rotation is always covered.
- **Disable backup user:** If the backup user is disabled, no owner will be assigned when all users are unavailable.
- **Disable working hours when all users are unavailable:** If selected, the rotation will assign as if all users were available when everyone is outside their office hours, effectively bypassing office hours _only in that case_.

When you're done, click **Next** <Icon icon="arrow-right" /> to open the **Model** tab. The following options will appear:

- **Round Robin tab:** Distributes your records equally so every user receives the same number. Drag and drop users to change their order.

![Clean Shot2025 08 14at17 15 58 Pn](/images/CleanShot2025-08-14at17.15.58.png)

- **Percentage tab:** Controls the percentage of records each user will receive in each rotation. Adjust percentages by changing the corresponding numbers.

![Clean Shot2025 08 14at17 37 08 Pn](/images/CleanShot2025-08-14at17.37.08.png)

<Note>
  The total percentage must equal 100%; otherwise, Routera will return an error.
</Note>

- **View queue:** Previews how the first 100 records will be distributed under the selected model.

After setting up the router’s model, click **Next** to open the **Account Matching** tab. When enabled, this feature matches the owner (if available) of an associated object to the one selected in your router’s **HubSpot Configuration** tab.

For example, if you selected **Contacts** as the HubSpot object, **Account Matching** can match the owner of an associated company, deal, or ticket—provided those objects have an assigned owner.

When you click **Enable account matching**, the following options will appear:

- **Which HubSpot object do you want to match the owner from?** Select the desired object from the dropdown list.
- **Which object should we select?** Choose whether to match the _most recently updated_, _most recently created_, or _first created_ object.

![Clean Shot2025 08 14at18 03 52 Pn](/images/CleanShot2025-08-14at18.03.52.png)

When finished, click **Save & Publish** to publish your router.

### Setting Up a Workflow for Your Router

With your router published, you can now create a workflow to use it.

- In HubSpot, navigate to Automations on the left sidebar, then select **Workflows**. Then, go to **Create Workflow **on the upper right, and then **From Scratch**
- Click on **Skip trigger and choose eligible records**, and then select the object your router is based on (for example, if your router **HubSpot object** is **Contacts**, select **Contact** on this option), then click on **Save and continue**
- After setting up your [workflow triggers](https://knowledge.hubspot.com/workflows/set-your-workflow-enrollment-triggers), click on the <Icon icon="circle-plus" /> Sign on your workflow to add an action
- On **Search actions**, type "Routera", then click on **Assign with Routera (V2)**
- You'll see the following section with a dropdown of all your created routers. Select the router you just created, and then **Save**
