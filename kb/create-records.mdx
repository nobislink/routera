### Example Use Cases

#### Using **AND**

Suppose you want to find all **contacts in the United States who are assigned to a specific user**:

1. Add a filter where **Country = United States**.
2. Add another filter where **Contact Owner = (a user name)**.
3. Use the **AND** operator to combine them.

This will return only contacts who match **both** conditions.

Suppose you want to find all **contacts located in either the United States or Canada**:

1. Add a filter where **Country = United States**.
2. Add another filter where **Country = Canada**.
3. Use the **OR** operator to combine them.

This will return contacts who match **either** condition.
