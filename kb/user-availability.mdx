### Editing Your Availability

To set your availability, go to **Settings** <Icon icon="gear" /> in the upper-right corner of your screen, then click **Working Hours**. The screen will display the following sections:

- **Availability:** This switch allows you to manually turn your availability on or off, regardless of the working hours set in **Working Hours**.
- **Timezone:** Your location's timezone. The **Working Hours** you select below will be based on this timezone.
- **Working hours:** The schedule Routera uses to determine your availability for assignments. Assignments will only occur within these hours if your **Availability** is turned on.

You'll find three dropdowns:

- The first dropdown lets you select a day of the week or a range of days (such as Monday through Friday).
- The second dropdown sets the start time of your availability block.
- The third dropdown sets the end time of your availability block.

You can add multiple availability blocks by clicking **\+ Add Hours**. For example, if you work a standard Monday–Friday, 9 AM to 5 PM shift with a lunch break, you could set your availability as follows:
