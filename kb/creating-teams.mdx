Creating teams in Routera is optional but strongly recommended, as it lets you remove users from multiple routers at once by updating their team, rather than removing them from each router individually

### Creating Teams

To create a **Team** on Routera, go to **Settings** <Icon icon="gear" /> in the upper-right corner of your screen, then click on **Teams \> Create Team**.

A sidebar will appear on the right side of your screen with the following sections:

- **Team name:** The name for your team (example: Marketing)
- **Team managers:** Users who can modify and manage team members’ **Availability** and **Working Hours**
- **Team members:** Users who will be receiving assignments

To proceed, select team members and team managers for your team by clicking their corresponding checkboxes, and then click **Create Team** when finished.

To add a manager, click **Add Managers**. To add a member, open the **Members** tab and click **Add Users**. In both cases, a sidebar will appear where you can select users. When finished, click Add.

<Note>
  Adding a current Team Member as a Manager will remove them from the Team Member section and vice versa/
</Note>

When you're done, click on <Icon icon="arrow-left" /> **Back to all teams**.
