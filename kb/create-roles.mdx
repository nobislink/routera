There are two types of default roles in Routera:

- **Administrators**: Administrators have full access to your Records, Routers, and Settings in your Routera account.
- **Members**: Members can only change their profile, which allows them to modify their own working hours, out-of-office dates, and calendars. They do not have access to other settings in your account or to your routers or records.

<Note>
  Default roles can't be modified or deleted.
</Note>

You can also create custom roles to give specific users more granular access. If you’re an **Administrator**, follow these steps to create one:

Open your account **Settings** <Icon icon="gear" />, then click on the **Roles** tab, and then on **Create Role**. This will open a new screen with the following options:

- The **Records** tab, which controls access to the Records section.
- The **Router** tab, which controls access to your routers.
- The **Settings** tab, which controls access to each section of your account settings.

On each tab, you'll find a table of permissions that consists of:

- **Read:** The user can view or access the item.
- **Create:** The user can create the item.
- **Edit:** The user can modify the item.
- **Delete:** The user can delete the item (when applicable).

The following is an example of what you'll see on the **Settings** tab. Notice that each element corresponds to a tab in your settings section (except Teams, which is within the Users tab):

Adjust the permissions in these columns as needed. When you’re finished, click **Save** to save your changes.

To apply your new role to a user:

- Click on **Settings** <Icon icon="gear" />, then the **Users** tab.
- Select the user you want to apply the role to, and then click <Icon icon="pencil" iconType="regular" /> **Edit**.
- Select the role you just created from the dropdown, then click **Save**.
