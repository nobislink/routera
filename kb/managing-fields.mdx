In Routera, you can assign users to the following object types:

- Contacts
- Companies
- Deals
- Tickets

If necessary, you can also create data fields so you can store additional information in them. The available data field types are:

- Single-line text
- Number
- Single checkbox (yes/no)
- Dropdown
- Date
- User

<Note>
  If you have connected a HubSpot user, creating a **user** field will create an owner field in **HubSpot**
</Note>

Follow these steps to create a data field in Routera:

- Go to **Settings** <Icon icon="gear" />, and open the **Data Fields** tab
- Click on **Create Fields**
- Select the object you want to create a field for in the **Object Type **dropdown
